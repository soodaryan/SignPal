# SignPal: Your friendly digital avatar companion for effortless Sign Language Communication

SignPal is an innovative tool designed to bridge the communication gap for the deaf community. Our goal is to enable seamless translation of all types of audio inputs, including phone calls, YouTube videos, and other media, into sign language in real-time. IT is a complex system that uses NLTK, NLP models, SigML, and several other APIs to convert audio to text to ISL and then generate an avatar that uses the sigml for ISL gestures in real-time.
